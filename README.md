# Todo App V3 (TodoMVC Clone)

This app was modelled around [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/examples/react/) with React and Typescript. I'm still currently working on this one! Keep an eye out for changes.

## How to run the application:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run npm install
3. Run npm start

## Mastery Learning

You're probably wondering why there are multiple versions of the same app. These projects were made to refine my React skills, as well as learn Typescript using [Mastery Learning](https://youtu.be/GWa48XRnLh0).
